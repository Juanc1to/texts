# Work share compensation

I have been reflecting on two challenges related to how we compensate members for work at SoFA.  The first is related to how individual members account for their work (and in particular, how I account for my work), and the second is related to how we can create a fair and accessible budget for that work.  As I've been thinking about both of these problems, I've been developing an idea that might help address them both together.

One difficulty that I face when doing work for SoFA is navigating the space between volunteer work and compensated work.  I might be updating some documentation around how we use IT tools at SoFA, but then I find myself thinking about some related ideas and I want to do a bit of investigation and write down some notes.  Some of that is compensated work, and some of that is just my own excitement to explore what is possible.  Or I may be in a meeting acting in a compensated role, and parts of the meeting involve more casual social interaction with members.  Or I may be sorting through my email, where some of the messages clearly relate to compensated work, and others I would prefer to consider as a volunteer contribution.  I find so many places where my energy and attention dances between compensated work and volunteer work.  It's very difficult for me to account for this dance, and I very strongly suspect that my accounting is, historically, inaccurate (and pretty substantially innaccurate, at that).

From the perspective of the larger organization, recently at SoFA we have been struggling with a situation in which we have had more monetary expenses than the income we bring in, and these expenses are strongly dominated by compensating some members for their work.  As you might expect, this struggle has been tumultuous and painful.  In many hierarchical organizations, situations like this might lead to firing some employees, but as a sociocratic organization we want to find ways to support each other.

Considering both of the above situations, I've been thinking about possible techniques for distributing money to members that could be easy while still providing space for circles to hold some power and autonomy over the energy their members can put into their work.  One of my goals here is certainly to help make estimating and accounting for our work easy.  I describe one such idea below—**work share compensation**; I wonder what you might think of it!

## How work share compensation … works

The heart of work share compensation is a unit of work and compensation called a **share**.  When it is representing work, a share provides a unit of measure for an approximate amount of time or energy that a member wants to put into working for their organization (such as SoFA) and a particular circle.  I imagine a share being loosely based on an amount of time, such as 3 or 5 hours, that would be decided by the organization, but it is also intended to offer some flexibility for conversation between a member and themselves and their circle regarding fairness, intensity of the work, and amount of volunteer effort they are wanting to provide.  If we think of a share as roughly 5 hours of work, then we might note that 8 shares of work per week would be roughly equivalent to working full-time in the United States (and 6 shares of work would be roughly equivalent to working full-time in some parts of Europe).

When it is representing compensation, a share represents an equal part of the money available to distribute to members in a particular period.  Some circle would hold the domain for determining the compensation pool (for **the whole organization**) each compensation period.  That pool would then be divided equally among all shares: a member would receive that amount of money from the compensation pool for each share of work they had done during the period.  As we are thinking about sociocratic organizations, the circle with this domain would have the normal sociocratic mechanisms for transparency and feedback around this decision.

## Example: a design group

As an example, consider a small design group of four people: Devon, Alice, James, and Candice. Devon plans mainly on talking with clients and communicating plans to the group. Alice and James plan on developing designs from the client plans, and Candice plans on focusing on their website. At a meeting to discuss their budget, they agree on shares corresponding to about 5 hours of work, and they explore how much work they believe there will be in each role and how much capacity each of them has. Based on this, they agree that Devon will take on 2 shares per week, Alice will take on 4 shares per week, James will take on 3 shares per week, and Candice will take on 1 share per week.

They work for a compensation period of two weeks, and after that period they convene to discuss their work and their revenues. Based upon their previous agreement, after two weeks Devon would have worked 4 total shares, Alice would have worked 8 total shares, James would have worked 6 total shares, and Candice would have worked 2 total shares. Reviewing this, Candice mentions that they actually worked 3 shares, and James mentions that they actually worked 5 shares; they all are satisfied with these adjustments. (The total, conveniently, is still 20 shares.) During the compensation period their group has received $3000, and they decide to apply $1000 of that amount to an emergency fund and distribute the remaining $2000 as the compensation pool for that period. Let's say that § stands for a unit of share. Based on their shares (of the 20§ total), then, Devon is compensated with (4§/20§) * $2000 = $400, Alice is compensated with (8§/20§) * $2000 = $800, James is compensated with (5§/20§) * $2000 = $500, and Candice is compensated with (3§/20§) * $2000 = $300. Based upon working *exactly* 5 hours per share, this would result in an hourly wage *for this compensation period* of $20/hour for each of them.

As a group they know that this can change as they bring in different revenues in different periods, and they also know that how they each measure their work for a particular share is flexible. They check in with each other about those elements regularly.

## Variable compensated hours

One way to think about this is that operating within the work share compensation system provides compensation at a fixed rate for a variable number hours.  So the organization could say that it is going to provide a fixed (base) wage, but for a particular compensation period it would only be able to pay that wage for a particular number of hours (per share).  Members could consider their hours in each share beyond that compensation point to be volunteer hours, or extra compensation beyond the normal wage for the hours corresponding to a share to be a bonus.

## Decisions to add shares

If any circle wanted to add shares to any of their members, which would include adding shares for new members or newly compensated members, then this would simply stretch the overall compensation pool further.  In theory, this should make balancing the payroll side of the budget trivial.  Discussion and decisions for the compensation pool circle and the whole organization would then instead focus around:

1. Is everyone happy with the total number of shares being distributed across the organization (or within a particular circle)?
2. Are we satisfied with the level of income relative to the total number of shares being compensated from that income?  If not, how do we want to try to adjust either or both of the level of income for the organization or the number of shares of work being claimed?

As mentioned above, it would also be important for circles to stay in conversation with their members about whether everyone is happy with the amount of actual work that corresponds to the reported shares of work claimed by those members.  And we would, of course, want to be up front about these details.  Members and circles would consider the total number of shares being contributed each compensation period, and based on historic and projected monetary income by the organization would be able to estimate how many of their actual hours would be compensated at a particular rate (and thus how many of the total hours would be essentially volunteered), and they could use that information to guage their capacity to contribute.  (And this works both ways, of course: increased organizational income or a decrease in total shares would increase the number of fully compensated hours available per share.)

## Adjustments

The above description of the work share compensation system does not provide any mechanism for adjusting the "wage" provided in compensation for a share, but an organization could invite members and circles to provide an adjustment factor for members.  This could help to account for factors of need, exchange rate, cost of living difference, or skill level needed for the work, for example. This would scale the proportion of a member's compensation when the distribution process happens, and so it should also be fairly trivial to implement.

## Some feedback questions for periodic review by circles and members

1. Do you think your number of shares represents the proportional work that you are doing compared to your circle mates or circle's domain?
2. Roughly estimated as the organization's chosen number of hours per share, does this share feel like a useful unit of work?
