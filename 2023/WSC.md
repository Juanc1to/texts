# Work share compensation

I have been reflecting on two challenges related to how we compensate members for work at SoFA.  The first is related to how individual members account for their work (and in particulary, how I account for my work), and the second is related to how we can create a fair and accessible budget for that work.  As I've been thinking about both of these problems together, I've been developing an idea that might help address both problems.

One difficulty that I face when doing work for SoFA is navigating the space between volunteer work and compensated work.  I might be updating some documentation around how we use IT tools at SoFA, but then I find myself thinking about some related ideas and I want to do a bit of investigation and write down some notes.  Some of that is compensated work, and some of that is just my own excitement to explore what is possible.  Or I may be in a meeting acting in a compensated role, and parts of the meeting involve more casual social interaction with members.  Or I may be sorting through my email, where some of the messages clearly relate to compensated work, and others I would prefer to consider as a volunteer contribution.  I find so many places where my energy and attention dances between compensated work and volunteer work.  It's very difficult for me to account for this dance, and I very strongly suspect that my accounting is, historically, inaccurate.

From the perspective of the larger organization, recently at SoFA we have been struggling with a situation in which we have had more monetary expenses than the income we bring in, and these expenses are strongly dominated by compensating some members for their work.  As you might expect, this struggle has been tumultuous and painful.  In many hierarchical organizations, situations like this might lead to firing some employees, but as a sociocratic organization we want to find ways to support each other.

Considering both of the above situations, I've been thinking about possible techniques for distributing money to members that could be easy while still providing space for circles to hold some power and autonomy over the energy their members can put into their work.  One of my goals here is certainly to help make estimating and accounting for our work easy.  I describe one such idea below—**work share compensation**; I wonder what you might think of it!

## How work share compensation … works

The heart of work share compensation is a unit of work and compensation called a **share**.  When it is representing work, a share provides a unit of measure for an approximate amount of time or energy that a member wants to put into working for their organization (such as SoFA) and a particular circle.  I imagine a share being loosely based on an amount of time, such as 3 or 5 hours, that would be decided by the organization, but it is also intended to offer some flexibility for conversation between a member and themselves and their circle regarding fairness, intensity of the work, and amount of volunteer effort they are wanting to provide.  If we think of a share as roughly 5 hours of work, then we might note that 8 shares of work per week would be roughly equivalent to working full-time in the United States (and 6 shares of work would be roughly equivalent to working full-time in some parts of Europe).

When it is representing compensation, a share represents an equal part of the money available to distribute to members in a particular period.  Some circle would hold the domain for determining the compensation pool (for **the whole organization**) each compensation period.  That pool would then be divided equally among all shares: you would receive that amount of money for each share of work you had done during the period from the compensation pool.

## Notes for currently unwritten sections

- General reflections on the implications of this system
- Discussing how individual members choose to fulfill their shares of work and track that work, and how they continue to report on the fit between their work and their shares to the circles that hold the roles
- A section about the possibility of using an adjustment factor based on need/exchange rate
- Discussion about how this could be interpreted as either a variable wage or a fixed wage for a variable number of compensated hours, with the remaining hours being counted as volunteer time
- Possibilities for a policy where we explicitly caution our compensated members that the number of hours—compensated at a fixed hourly wage—would vary between compensation period based on the pool available for compensation and the number of shares dividing that pool

## Some feedback questions for periodic review by circles and members

1. Do you think your number of shares represents the proportional work that you are doing compared to your circle mates or circle's domain?
2. Roughly estimated as the organization's chosen number of hours per share, does this share feel like a useful unit of work?

(more members, more work claimed by existing members, or both)

## Tensions and goals

1. Wanting a system that allows members to more easily estimate the future use of their time and energy.
2. Wanting a system that has a low need for accounting, particularly for individual members.

At SoFA we, like so many organizations, provide monetary compensation for many of our members ([sad to be so dependent on money](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2X4_-1_rbjqHcXq1icqfRWXhuoQGxbex1hg8u5kLGk/edit#heading=h.1mtd14cpfszb), I know, but we have a lot of members who are stretching for alternatives).

## Additional considerations

I wonder if we might benefit from having a policy where we explicitly caution our compensated members that the number of compensated hours
